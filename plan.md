The initial prompt: "I would like to build a telegram chat bot to help people to learn mandarin chinese; the person should be able to choose his level (hsk-1 to hsk-6), and if he would like to practice english or chinese; the the bot should show him a word on a language he selected, and he suppose to guess the word translation, e.g. he selected chinese and bot should show him word "回", the person should answer "return". DO NOT code anything just prepare a plan for a junior enigneer, if you need to write code, write only pseudo code"

Great! Let's create a proper Python project structure. We'll need to:
Set up a virtual environment and dependencies
Create the main bot structure
Create models for our vocabulary
Implement the game logic
Add configuration management
Let's start by creating a pyproject.toml for our dependencies and project configuration:
 
I would like to build a telegram chat bot to help people to learn mandarin chinese; the person should be able to choose his level (hsk-1 to hsk-6), and if he would like to practice english or chinese; the the bot should show him a word on a language he selected, and he suppose to guess the word translation, e.g. he selected chinese and bot should show him word "回", the person should answer "return". DO NOT code anything just prepare a plan for a junior enigneer, if you need to write code, write only pseudo code

I'll help you create a plan for building this Mandarin learning Telegram bot. Here's a structured approach that a junior engineer can follow:
1. Project Setup
Apply to plan.md
md
2. Dependencies
python-telegram-bot - For Telegram bot functionality
pandas - For reading CSV files
python-dotenv - For environment variables
pytest - For testing
ruff - For linting
3. Data Model (pseudo code)
Apply to plan.md
int
4. Main Components
4.1. Bot Setup (pseudo code)
Apply to plan.md
mode
4.2. Game Logic (pseudo code)
Apply to plan.md
score
5. User Flow
User starts bot (/start)
Bot asks for HSK level (1-6)
Bot asks for practice mode (Chinese→English or English→Chinese)
Bot shows word in selected language
User provides answer
Bot checks answer and provides feedback
Bot shows next word
6. Testing Plan
Unit tests for:
Word model
Answer checking
Score calculation
Integration tests for:
Bot command handling
Game flow
Mock tests for:
Telegram API calls
CSV file reading
7. Implementation Steps
Set up project structure and dependencies
Implement data models
Create basic bot structure with command handlers
Implement vocabulary loading
Add game logic
Add scoring system
Write tests
Add error handling
Add logging
Deploy bot
8. Error Handling Considerations
Invalid HSK level selection
Malformed CSV files
Network issues with Telegram API
Invalid user inputs
Session timeouts
9. Future Improvements
Add user statistics tracking
Implement spaced repetition
Add difficulty levels
Add audio pronunciation
Add example sentences
Add progress tracking
Add multiplayer mode
Add daily challenges
10. Security Considerations
Validate all user inputs
Sanitize CSV data
Rate limiting
User data protection
Secure token storage
This plan provides a solid foundation for building the bot while keeping the code organized and maintainable. A junior engineer can follow this structure and implement each component step by step.
